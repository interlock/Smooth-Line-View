Smooth line Canvas 
====================

The original goal of this project is to create a UIView that can generate smooth lines from touch input in a reasonably fast manner without moving to a more complex framework like OpenGL.

Having found that success, it has been converted to a UI Widget that can be implemented in to projects. A UIImageView was extened to SLCanvas, which has abstracted out some of the core drawing functionality. 

This view uses two methods of smoothing:

1. **Catmull Rom spline:** (Shows in red.) This seems to have the best results as far as curve smoothing. However it gets _really_ slow over a certain number of points. So I switch interpolation methods to the following for more complex curvesâ€¦
2. **Bezier Interpolation:** (Shows in green.) This method is very fast and doesn't care how complex the path is. The view uses some math to calculate the control points. The results aren't as good as the Catmull Rom but _much_ faster and with more complex shapes the differences are hard to notice.



### TODO

* Still need to find the best threshold to switch to Bezier from Catmull Rom.
* Implement optimized frame drawing area for Bezier and Catmull
* Implement a way to pass drawing properties to the SLDrawProtocol implementations: color, size, etc.
* Optimize touch events in Canvas to reduce number of events stored
* Provide way to serialize whole canvas as points
* Provide easy way to export image of the canvas
